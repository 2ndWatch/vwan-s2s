# Azure S2S Troubleshooting with Log Analytics Workspace

## Purpose

This Terraform code deploys an Azure Site-to-Site (S2S) Virtual Network Gateway (VPN Gateway) and associates it with an Azure Virtual WAN. Additionally, it creates a Log Analytics Workspace to collect and store VPN Gateway logs for troubleshooting purposes. The Log Analytics Workspace enables central log monitoring and analysis, providing insights into VPN Gateway connectivity and any potential issues that may arise during the S2S setup and operations.
